<!-- JavaScript Functionality:

This is going to be the most difficult part. What will need to happen is for each post to displayed in a div
displaying the following information (from post table):
 - Post title (Preferably displayed in an h2)
 - Post content (Displayed in a p)
 - Submitted by (displaed in a p)
 - A view replies button or link (ATTENTION: THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: In order for this to work properly, we
 will need to store a variable that corresponds to what post's replies are to be viewed upon clicking this link, which
 will direct the user to makereply.html. This variable can be done the same way as the logged-in variable is done
 where every time you click on view replies, the variable will be updated to reflect the post id of the post to which
 the reply button is attached. It will make sense why this must be done when you see how the make reply page is set up,
 but this MUST BE DONE! I am calling this variable currentPost)
