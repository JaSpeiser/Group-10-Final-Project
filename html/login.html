<!-- JavaScript Functionality:
Cross check username and password with entries of user table in database.
 - If matching entry exists, direct to index.html.
 - If no matching entry exists, simply display error message in pop up and do nothing

Furthermore, in order to keep track of who is making and replying to posts, it makes sense to store who is currently
logged in somehow. This variable should be updated every time somebody logs in because I am adding the ability to log
out. To make this function, the variable should be reset upon visiting the login page. I would imagine the easiest
way to store this information would be to have an integer that corresponds to user_id in the table. Upon visiting the
login page, I would reset this variable to -99 because that will never be an entry in the user table. I'm calling this
variable currentUser.
